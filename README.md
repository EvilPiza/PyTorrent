***Since this is privated for now, TODOS!!***

- More colors!! (Probably lowest prio)
- Fix connection between front/backend (Front end done, back 90% done)
- Preferences!! (for more customization) (Highest prio)
- Make frontend use concurrent stuff so it doesn't freeze when waiting on backend

**Once these are done then *MAYBE* i'll release v1**

***Might DOs:***

- Make backend public (or at least release a template of what I use)
- Get a friend to help with frontend (man screw front end)
