***Since this is privated for now, TODOS!!***

- More colors!! (Probably lowest prio)
- Fix connection between front/backend (Front end done, back 90% done)
- Preferences!! (for more customization) (Highest prio)

**Once these are done then *MAYBE* i'll release v1**

***Might DOs:***

- Rewrite frontend in something other than python lmao (prolly js) (backend is alr perfect)
- Make backend public
- Get a friend to help with frontend (man screw front end)
